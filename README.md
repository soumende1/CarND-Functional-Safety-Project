# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System



This project consist on creating the documentation for the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system under the umbrella of the Road vehicles - Functional safety : ISO 26262. ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety on electrical and/or electronic system in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Lane Assistance system is part of a Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS) with the following functionalities:

- #### Lane departure warning: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel vibrates to alert the driver.
- #### Lane keeping assistance: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel is turned toward the center of the        lane to keep the car on its current lane


### Description of  Files

First the template files were dowloaded from the Udacity link as given here.  [Link to templates](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project)

The Udacity repo also contains a PDF file called **Project_Instructions.pdf**. This document gives information about how to approach the project and what is expected. Using the instructions provided in the files, the following five templates were filled accordingly and the converted into pdf files, which can be found by clicking the respective link below.


* [01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.doc](./01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance_SD.pdf)

* [02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.xlsx](./02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment_SD.pdf)

* [03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc](./03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance_SD.pdf)

* [04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc](./04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance_SD.pdf)

* [05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.doc](./05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance_SD.pdf)

You will need to fill out all five of these documents in order to meet specifications.  

The repo also contains an Architecture_Diagrams folder containing visuals that you will need to complete the reports. These visuals are in no particular order, and you will decide in which document or documents they belong.
